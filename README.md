# DIYThrottle
Flight sim throttle design

I probably wont be uploading better documentation, as it is more difficult and boring than I expected. Sorry.

Version numbers are from Fusion, so they may not increase one by one.

Hats are JFlyer81's 4/5 way hats: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4543158

Two way switch on the middle finger is a modified version of Huzarski's hat switch (namely, it is a modified version of his "Body #B" which can be used for 2 or 3 way switches: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3641494

Grip is heavily modified from Olukelo's design: https://github.com/o-devices/throttle-quadrant 

Namely, modifications include:

a TDC slew instead of pushbutton for index finger

split throttle design

removal of the two potentiometers on the pinkie and middle finger in favor of a pushbutton and a 2/3 way hat

Re-arrangement of the hats and removal of one of the two buttons on the right side to fit the TDC slew

simple latching mechanism

Addition of screw and nut holes for M4 and M2 nuts and bolts to keep the grip together, as well as four M2.5-M3 screws for the latching mechanism


**Current BOM:**

4x 6802ZZ Bearings for the two arms

2x 685ZZ Bearings for the detent rollers

2x 5x5x10mm neodymium magnets

2x KMA 210 Magnoresistive sensors

2x RC shocks for damping (130mm between centers of mounting holes, remove springs, recommend using 70wt shock oil)

Assorted M5, M4, M3, M2, M2.5 (optional) nuts and bolts of lengths ranging from 8 to 20mm for the M2-M4 bolts and 8 to 40mm for the M5 bolts. I will provide a complete count soon (TM). The better assembly files have screws in them, you can count for yourself.

2x 0.6x7x25mm expansion springs with hooks for the fingerlifts

Approx 2x 30x45mm and 2x 30x40mm felt pads for friction pads, recommend greasing with Nyogel 767A

Loads of PETG filament

Alps RKJXV1224005 analog ministick + PCB (files included)

Shift register board (PCB files included)

15-18 6x6x4.3mm tact switches

2x 20mm endstop switches for OFF/IDLE binds, 4x 20mm endstop switches for hook and gear levers by JumpNShootMan (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4645392)

2x OTTO P1-1 or P3-1 Pushbutton (2.5lb actuation recommended)

a cheap ebay pushbutton with no tactile feedback for the pinkie button

2020 Extrusion corners

M5 and M4 T nuts and screws

approx 3.7m of 2020 extrusion, some with ends tapped

T plates

Bessey STC-IHH 25 toggle clamp

Assorted 12mm toggle switches (8 ON/OFF and 3 ON/OFF/ON)

Assorted buttons (I am using a pair of ebay pushbuttons and a sanwa arcade button for eject)
