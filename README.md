# DIYThrottle
Work in progress flight sim throttle design

Hats are going to be JFlyer81's 4/5 way hats: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4543158

Two way switch on the middle finger is a modified version of Huzarski's hat switch (namely, it is a modified version of his "Body #B" which can be used for 2 or 3 way switches: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3641494

Grip is heavily modified from Olukelo's design: https://github.com/o-devices/throttle-quadrant 

Namely, modifications include:
a TDC slew instead of pushbutton for index finger
split throttle design
removal of the two potentiometers on the pinkie and middle finger in favor of a pushbutton and a 2/3 way hat
Re-arrangement of the hats and removal of one of the two buttons on the right side to fit the TDC slew
simple latching mechanism
Addition of screw and nut holes for M4 and M2 nuts and bolts to keep the grip together, as well as four M2.5-M3 screws for the latching mechanism

Current BOM:

4x 6802ZZ Bearings for the two arms

2x 685ZZ Bearings for the detent rollers

Assorted M5x8, M4, M3, M2, M2.5 (optional) nuts and bolts of lengths ranging from 8 to 20mm for the M2-M4 bolts and 8 to 40mm for the M5 bolts. I will provide a complete count once I am done with the design

2x 0.6x7x25mm expansion screws with hooks for the fingerlifts

Approx 2x 30x45mm and 2x 30x40mm felt pads

Loads of PETG filament

Alps RKJXV1224005 analog ministick + PCB (files included)

Shift register board (PCB files included)

15-18 6x6x4.3mm tact switches

2x OTTO P1-11112 Pushbutton (probably)

a cheap ebay pushbutton with no tactile feedback for the pinkie button

FUTURE ADDITIONS:

Planning on adding a 130mm RC shock without spring for damping

Will design a frame later on
